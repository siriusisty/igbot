# Instagram Hashtag Follower

This is a Python program that automatically follows users on Instagram based on specific hashtags. It uses the `instagrapi` library to interact with Instagram. The program runs in a loop, continuously searching for new hashtags and following users who have made recent posts with those hashtags.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, make sure you have the following:

1. Python installed (Python 3.x recommended)
2. An Instagram account with valid credentials (username and password)
3. A valid proxy server (optional) to avoid IP blocking

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
pip install instagrapi python-dotenv
``````
